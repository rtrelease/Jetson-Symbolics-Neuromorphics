## <u>AI Lab Notes</u>

#### **Gedanken Experiment 1:**

One of the objectives of all this development is to support ongoing AI research into network models that operate like known biological neurons, especially cortical microcircuits. 

About 10 years ago, I was working with a simulator that used 16 Arduino Micros to model spiking, analog threshold-triggered pyramidal and interneurons.
