#### **Controlling *neuronal* hardware simulators:** Gearing up for Arduino microcontrollers and all **THAT**

One of the objectives of all this development is to support ongoing AI research into new network models that operate like known analog 'spiking' biological neurons, especially cortical microcircuits. 

About 10 years ago, I was working with a simulator that used 16 Arduino Micros to model spiking, analog threshold-triggered pyramidal and interneurons in a simple neocortical microcircuit.  A relatively simple addition of the Arduino IDE to the existing Java environments for for Xeon RTX workstation and the ARM64 AGX Orin Developer Kit gave access to this original simulator and its Arduino Mega 2560 controller.
