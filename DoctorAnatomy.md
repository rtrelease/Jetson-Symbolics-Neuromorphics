## <u>AI Lab Notes</u>

#### ***Chats with*** **Doctor Anatomy -** ***Core anatomical knowledge in open source large language models***

[Earlier AI Lab Notes](https://github.com/rtrelease/Jetson-Symbolics-Neuromorphics/blob/main/Onto1.md) and linked [publications](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.20095) covered legacy symbolic programming approaches to anatomical reasoning prior to the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs).  

Having been a research university developer through prior decades of symbolic AI -- with their emphases on knowledge bases, ontologies, logical inference engines, and explanability of inferential logic -- there were some recent moments of cognitive dissonance on seeing DNN output processes newly defined as *inferences*.

So a major theme of these AI Lab Notes has been addressing some currently perceived shortcomings of DNN-based AI, including explainability of inferences, with hybrid neuro-symbolic programming.

The more philological aspects of reconciling AI legacy symbolic and DNN/ML inferencing connotations is probably best left to historians and authors of [artificial intelligence textbooks](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/index.html).
