## <u>AI Lab Notes</u>

#### ***Chats with*** **Doctor Anatomy -** ***Core anatomical knowledge in open source large language models***

[Earlier AI Lab Notes](https://github.com/rtrelease/Jetson-Symbolics-Neuromorphics/blob/main/Onto1.md) and linked [publications](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.20095) have covered legacy symbolic programming approaches to anatomical reasoning prior to the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs).  

Having been a research university developer through prior decades of *symbolic* AI -- with their emphases on knowledge bases, ontologies, logical inference engines, and explanability of inferential logic -- there were some more recent moments of cognitive dissonance on seeing DNN output processes newly defined as *inferences*.

So a practical major theme of these AI Lab Notes has been addressing some currently perceived shortcomings of DNN-based AI applications, including explainability of inferences, with hybrid neuro-symbolic programming.

The more philological aspects of reconciling AI legacy symbolic and DNN/ML inferencing connotations is probably best left to historians and authors of [artificial intelligence textbooks](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/index.html).
My tasks as a neuroscientist building and using AI tools have simply involved accomodation, adaptation, and redefinition of new information, familiar real biological brain functions. 

No, current DNNs aren't really "neural" or fundamentally inspired by deep knowledge of human brain functional anatomy, BUT [***eppur si muove***](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_yet_it_moves), they work and do some remarkable computing tasks! 

Besides, neuromorphic modeling can also address more rigorous biological neuron network designs, since human brain cognitive mechanisms naturally support handling conflicting concepts...

**On to the current series of *anatomical reasoning* experiments** with new Open Source large language models (LLMs) provided in the great new NVIDIA Jetson Generative AI Lab containers.  In this instance, we are creating a chatbot character called Doctor Anatomy to answer questions about breadth and depth of anatomical knowledge contained in LlaMa 2.
