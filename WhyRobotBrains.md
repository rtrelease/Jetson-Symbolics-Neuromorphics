### Why Use *Robot Brains*?  Reflections on the Science of Artificial Intelligence within Global Commercial Bubbles

*This Note will serve as a preface for the collected* **AI Lab Notes**, *as well as a commentary on the current NVIDIA Jetson state-of-the-art for physical computing, AI, and robotics for Edge laboratories.*

**Backstory**

With the greatest of respect: The perspectives presented in this Repository do not represent those of a professional engineer, data sci quant, or physicist. These are the Lab Notes of an emeritus neuroscientist who first trained on analyzing EEG and other physiological data on the first generation of laboratory instrumentation computers (Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-12) *in the late 1970s.*

Forward-looking at the time, my biomedical research Doctoral program had supported productive computer programming as fulfilling one of its legacy scholarly language requirements. We had to produce our own data acquisition and analysis programs for research and scientific journal publications, and FORTH was then the chosen language for directly processing data from from new analog instrumentation and other lab peripherals.

By the 1980s, our behavioral neurophysiology lab had evolved to using 16 bit PDP-11 minicomputers and their first-generation IC-based LSI-11 successors. While doing follow-on research in an NIMH postdoctoral fellowship, I also started studying artificial intelligence and symbolic programming on early personal computers.

Since contemporary AI research encompassed understanding cognitive functions and  computation with early primitive model 'neurons', it seemed a valuable scientific asset that could be enhanced with deep understanding of biological brains and behaviors. Stuart and Norvig's [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach) became a new foundational textbook for an academic neuroscientist.

Embedded in symbolic programming at the outset, it was especially great to ingest the volumes of [Parallel Distributed Processing](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4424/Parallel-Distributed-Processing-Volume) when they were first released. Rumelhart, Hinton, McClelland and the scholars of the PDP group clearly pointed the way forward from multi-layered perceptrons toward the present hyperfunctional deep neural networks.

My symbolic programming research progressed into qualitative process theory (QPT) and modeling After getting a medical school faculty appointment with major teaching responsibilities in functional anatomy and neurosciences, . 

I finally started studying artificial neural networks in action after the turn of the new millennium.  First came MatLab experiments with their Neural Networks and Machine Learning Toolboxes and server-based NVIDIA GPUs.
