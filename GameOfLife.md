### **Cellular automata, Turing machines and the *Game of Life* with Jetson CLIPS**

When topic map maven and dev friend Jack Park first alerted me to [Ryjo's new simple CLIPS implemention](https://ryjo.codes/articles/conways-game-of-life-written-in-clips.html) of the venerable cellular automaton, Conway's *Game of Life*, I copied and assembled the blog's in-text code ASAP. 

It just *had* to work on the AGX Orin with the latest version of CLIPS in the AI Lab Jetson software suite.  Sure enough, it was pretty straightforward.

Rather than carry on more about the significance of cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life in computational theory, including instantiating *Turing machines*, links are provided below to some very well written references about the most important details.
