## <u>AI Lab Notes</u>

### **Cellular automata, Turing machines, and the *Game of Life* with Jetson CLIPS**

When topic map maven and dev friend Jack Park first alerted me to [Ryjo's new simple CLIPS implemention](https://ryjo.codes/articles/conways-game-of-life-written-in-clips.html) of Conway's *Game of Life*, that blog's in-text code was copied and assemble-edited **ASAP**. 

After all, it just ***had*** to work on the AGX Orin with the latest ARM/aarch64 Ubuntu version of CLIPS in the AI Lab Jetson software suite. And so many of our efforts had been directed at modeling and simulation, with ***cellular automata*** like *Life* being classical rule-based process models...

Sure enough, it was a pretty straightforward task to make Life run from a CLIPS terminal command line (see image at bottom).  

Thanks Ryjo!  And yet again, thanks Jack!

Rather than carry on too much more about the significance of cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life in mathematics and computational theory, rule-based processing, and instantiating *Turing machines*, links are provided below to some very well written references about the most important details.

Many devoted researchers and developers have contributed to growing community resources for these dynamic 'a-life' models, automata such as glider-guns, pulsars, and rock-paper-scissors.
