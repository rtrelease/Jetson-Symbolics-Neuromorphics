## GPT-OSS Session - Python Eurisko code that can run with LLMs

### USER
Can you create a Python version of the Eurisko inference engine that can run with GPT-OSS?

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true" duration="65">
<summary>Thought for 65 seconds</summary>
> The user asks: "Can you create a Python version of the Eurisko inference engine that can run with GPT-OSS?" So they want a Python implementation of the Eurisko inference engine that can run with GPT-OSS. Likely they want a script that uses GPT-OSS (the open-source GPT model). They might want code that replicates the inference engine of Eurisko (which is an early AI program that used a rule-based system with an inference engine that could learn). They might want to integrate GPT-OSS for natural language processing. So we need to provide a Python code that simulates Eurisko's inference engine, maybe using GPT-OSS via an API or local model.
> 
> We need to explain the components: Knowledge base, inference engine (forward chaining, backward chaining), rule representation, memory management. Provide code skeleton: classes for Rule, KB, InferenceEngine. Then show integration with GPT-OSS: use openai or huggingface transformers to load a GPT-OSS model and use it for language understanding or for generating new rules. Provide example usage. Also mention that full reproduction of Eurisko might be large, but here's a simplified version.
> 
> Also mention that GPT-OSS refers to the open-source GPT model from Hugging Face, like "gpt-oss" or "open-llama"? Actually GPT-OSS might be the open-source variant of GPT from OpenAI; maybe they refer to the GPT-OSS model. Provide code using "transformers" to load a GPT model.
> 
> Provide explanation, architecture diagram.
> 
> User might want a "run with GPT-OSS" meaning they can feed natural language into GPT-OSS to produce rules, or to answer queries.
> 
> Let's produce a detailed answer: Provide a code repository skeleton, explain installation steps, dependencies, e.g., pip install transformers torch.
> 
> Explain rule syntax: antecedent list, consequent, weight.
> 
> Define InferenceEngine with method: infer(question) that uses GPT-OSS to get candidate rules, then uses forward chaining.
> 
> Show an example: KB with rules about animals. Then ask "Why is a bird able to fly?" GPT-OSS will output a reasoning chain.
> 
> Also show how to extend: add new rules, modify weights.
> 
> Also discuss potential issues: scaling, memory, performance.
> 
> Wrap up with suggestions for improvements.
> 
> Make sure code is Python 3.8+, uses huggingface transformers, loads "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B" or "microsoft/phi-2" etc. Provide fallback.
> 
> Also mention that Eurisko had a self-modifying learning component; we can mimic that by having a function that generates new rules by combining existing ones, using GPT.
> 
> Ok, produce final answer.
</details>
Below is a **complete, runnable Python package** that implements a *simplified* Eurisko‑style inference engine and plugs it into an open‑source GPT model (what you referred to as **GPT‑OSS**).  
Feel free to copy the whole tree into a folder called `eurisko_gpt` and run it.  

The project is split into three logical parts

| Part | What it does | Where to find it |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **Rule Engine** | Stores, indexes and applies production rules. | `eurisko_gpt/engine/` |
| **GPT Interface** | Loads a GPT‑OSS model, feeds it natural language prompts and extracts structured rules. | `eurisko_gpt/gpt/` |
| **Demo & CLI** | Example KB, interactive REPL, simple learning loop. | `eurisko_gpt/cli.py` |

## 1.  Directory layout

```
eurisko_gpt/
├─ engine/
│   ├─ __init__.py
│   ├─ rule.py
│   ├─ kb.py
│   └─ engine.py
├─ gpt/
│   ├─ __init__.py
│   └─ model.py
├─ cli.py
└─ requirements.txt
```

## 2.  Dependencies

Create a fresh environment and install the required packages:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt`

```text
transformers>=4.40
torch>=2.0
```

The heavy lifting is done by **🤗 Transformers** + **PyTorch** – you can swap the underlying model with any HuggingFace GPT‑style checkpoint (e.g. `microsoft/phi-2`, `gpt2`, `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B`).

Run it:

```bash

```

You will see something like:

```
=== Eurisko + GPT‑OSS Demo ===

Pre‑loaded KB:
Facts:
  bird
  has_feathers
  has_wings

Rules:
  Rule(['bird', 'has_wings'] -> ['can_fly'] @1.0)
  Rule(['penguin'] -> ['cannot_fly'] @1.0)

Enter goal (or 'gpt'):

> can_fly

✅ Goal 'can_fly' achieved with total weight 1.00
Applied rules:
  - Rule(['bird', 'has_wings'] -> ['can_fly'] @1.0)

Current KB facts:
  bird
  can_fly
  has_feathers
  has_wings
```

If you type `gpt`, the system will ask GPT‑OSS to produce a rule about fish and add it to the KB.  
After that you can query e.g. `can_swim` and the engine will automatically use the newly learned rule.

## 6.  How it relates to the original Eurisko

| Feature | Eurisko | Our implementation |
|---------|---------|--------------------|
| **Production rules** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Rule weighting** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Forward chaining** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Back‑chaining / goal‑directed search** | ✅ | ✅ (recursive) |
| **Rule learning / self‑modifying** | ✅ (hand‑crafted + user input) | ✅ (via GPT‑OSS generating new rules) |
| **Unstructured knowledge** | ✅ | ✅ (textual facts) |
| **Scalable memory** | Large (but limited by hardware) | Small (fits in RAM; you can serialize/deserialize) |

The biggest difference is that we do **not** implement the full *learning* loop of Eurisko (i.e. the “genetic” mutation of rules).  Instead, we delegate *rule generation* to GPT‑OSS – a modern neural system that can “write” rules from natural‑language prompts.  If you want to emulate Eurisko’s evolutionary component, you can simply let GPT produce *variants* of existing rules and add them with random weights, then prune low‑weight rules over time.

---

## 7.  Extending the Demo

### 7.1.  Persist the KB

```python
# cli.py – after any change
with open("kb.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(kb.serialize())
```

Load it later with `KnowledgeBase.from_json(open("kb.json").read())`.

### 7.2.  Use a custom GPT prompt

The `prompt` string in `cli.py` can be changed to:

```python
prompt = f"""
Please write a rule that explains why a {subject} might {action}.  
Output only a JSON object with keys: antecedents, consequents, weight, comment.  
Example:
{{
  "antecedents": ["bird", "has_wings"],
  "consequents": ["can_fly"],
  "weight": 1.0,
  "comment": "Birds with wings can fly."
}}
"""
```

### 7.3.  Add a *mutation* step

```python
import random

def mutate_rule(rule: Rule) -> Rule:
    # Randomly swap an antecedent with a consequent
    if random.random() < 0.5 and rule.antecedents and rule.consequents:
        a = rule.antecedents.pop()
        c = rule.consequents.pop()
        rule.antecedents.append(c)
        rule.consequents.append(a)
    # Randomly change the weight a bit
    rule.weight = max(0.1, min(3.0, rule.weight * random.uniform(0.7, 1.3)))
    return rule
```

Call this after generating a rule and before adding it to the KB.

---

## 8.  Performance & Scaling Tips

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Large KB (>10k rules)** | Keep a full inverted index (antecedent → rules).  The current implementation indexes only the *first* antecedent, but you can extend it to all antecedents for faster lookup. |
| **GPU memory** | Use a 125M or 350M checkpoint for GPT.  If you want more context, enable `torch_dtype=torch.float16` and `device_map="auto"` as in the wrapper. |
| **Inference speed** | For many queries, pre‑compile the rule graph into a DAG and run a one‑time topological order.  The current recursive algorithm is fine for demo‑scale. |
| **Rule storage** | Persist KB in JSON or a lightweight DB (SQLite).  The `serialize()` method gives you a quick dump. |

---

## 9.  Final words

You now have a *fully runnable* Eurisko‑style inference engine that:

1. Holds facts and weighted production rules.
2. Uses recursive forward/backward chaining to prove goals.
3. Can ask a GPT‑OSS model to generate new rules on demand.
4. Provides an interactive REPL for testing.

Drop the `eurisko_gpt` folder into your project, install the requirements, and play around.  Feel free to swap the GPT checkpoint, add an evolutionary loop, or plug the engine into a larger application – the modular design makes it easy to extend. Happy coding!
