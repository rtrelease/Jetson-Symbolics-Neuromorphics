#### **Gedanken Experiment 1:** Ontologies for semantic linking with deep neural networks' neuroanatomical structure identifications in brain magnetic resonance images


In a prior [scientific journal article](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.20095), I reviewed the concepts underlying anatomical reasoning and application of AI and symbolic programming for biostructural inference applications with large-scale ontologies.

The decade-plus following this work saw the rapid rise of deep neural networks and machine learning methods, as presaged by the seminal 1987 work on [parallel distributed processing](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262680530/parallel-distributed-processing/) and recurrent multilevel networks.  

Across the same time frame, enthusiasm for the application of ontologies moderated, and effective anatomical inference with medical imaging is now associated with deep learning systems like NVIDIA CLARA.  

Major [Open ontologies](https://bioportal.bioontology.org) have largely evolved from 2000s-era SQL database implemenations to flatter Web Ontology Language (OWL), RDF and XML formats representations, supported by the National Center for Biomedical Ontlogies funded by the National Institutes of Health. 

The focus of the current set of projects is to implement more **research-oriented** symbolic enhancement of brain imaging network applications, inasmuch as massive government research funding, academic training programs, and commercial development have been dedicated to widescale adoption of intelligent (and commercially valuable) clinical radiology systems.
