#### **Gedanken Experiment 1:** Ontologies for semantic linking with deep neural networks' neuroanatomical structure identifications in brain magnetic resonance images

In a prior [scientific journal article](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.20095), I reviewed the concepts underlying anatomical reasoning and application of symbolic programming for inference applications with large-scale ontologies.

The decade-plus following saw the rapid rise of deep neural network and machine learning methods, as presaged by the seminal work on parallel distributed processing and recurrent multilevel networks.
