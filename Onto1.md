#### **Gedanken Experiment 1:** Ontologies for semantic linking with deep neural network neuroanatomical structure identifications in brain magnetic resonance images


In a prior [2006 scientific journal article](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.20095), I reviewed the concepts underlying anatomical reasoning and application of AI research and symbolic programming methods to biostructural inference with large-scale ontologies.

The decade-plus following this work saw the rapid rise of deep neural networks and machine learning methods, presaged by the seminal 1987 PDP Group work on [parallel distributed processing](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262680530/parallel-distributed-processing/) and recurrent multilevel networks.  

As an academic neuroscientist and long-time symbolic coder also influenced by PDP (1987) concepts, I had begun studying ANN development with MatLab on NV Kepler-class GPUs.

Across this same post-millennial time frame, enthusiasm for the application of ontologies moderated, while effective anatomical inference in medical imaging has become associated with commercial deep learning systems such as NVIDIA CLARA.  

Major [Open ontologies](https://bioportal.bioontology.org) have largely evolved from 2000s-era frame-based SQL database implementations to flatter descriptive Web Ontology Language (OWL), RDF/XML and other format representations, with archive resources supported by the [National Center for Biomedical Ontology](https://ncbo.bioontology.org/ncbo-summary) and funded by the National Institutes of Health. 

***A focus of this current AI Lab sub-project is to investigate more*** **research-oriented** ***symbolic enhancement of brain imaging network applications.***  The task at hand here is to evaluate which current anatomical ontology might be best used for adding semantic bindings and advanced inference capabilities for structural identification and segmentation nets.

[An informative 2014 study](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1532046414001555) has studied the integration of several ontologies for a comparable task labeling medical imaging structures for producing anatomy-based model simulations.

Since massive government research funding, academic training programs, teams, publications, and commercial development have already been dedicated to widescale adoption of intelligent ($valuable$) and highly regulated clinical radiology systems, *we'll stick with the deeper basic aspects of neurosymbolic fusion for edge laboratory AI applications and research.*
