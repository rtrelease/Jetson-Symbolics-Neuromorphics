#### **Gedanken Experiment 1:** Ontologies for semantic linking with deep neural network neuroanatomical structure identifications in brain magnetic resonance images


In a prior [scientific journal article](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.20095), I reviewed the concepts underlying anatomical reasoning and application of AI and symbolic programming for biostructural inference applications with large-scale ontologies.

The decade-plus following this work saw the rapid rise of deep neural networks and machine learning methods, presaged by the seminal 1987 PDP Group work on [parallel distributed processing](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262680530/parallel-distributed-processing/) and recurrent multilevel networks.  

As an academic neuroscientist and long-time symbolic coder also influenced by PDP (1987), I had begun studying ANN development with MatLab on NV Kepler-class GPUs.

Across this same post-millennial time frame, enthusiasm for the application of ontologies moderated, while effective anatomical inference in medical imaging has become associated with commercial deep learning systems such as NVIDIA CLARA.  

Meanwhile, major [Open ontologies](https://bioportal.bioontology.org) have largely evolved from 2000s-era SQL database implementations to flatter Web Ontology Language (OWL), RDF/XML and other format representations, with archive resources supported by the [National Center for Biomedical Ontology](https://ncbo.bioontology.org/ncbo-summary) and funded by the National Institutes of Health. 

***A focus of this current AI Lab sub-project is to investigate more*** **research-oriented** ***symbolic enhancement of brain imaging network applications.***  The task at hand here is to evaluate which current anatomical ontology might be best used for inferential and semantic enhancements to structural identifications and segmentation.

And since massive government research funding, academic training programs, teams, publications, and commercial development have already been dedicated to widescale adoption of intelligent (and commercially valuable) clinical radiology systems, *we'll stick with the deeper basic aspects of neurosymbolic fusion for edge laboratory applications.*
