### Mu Editor Installation Update and pulse rate data acquisition with ARM 0+ CircuitPlayground Express

As previously noted, Adafruit has recommended using the open source Python Mu Editor with its CircuitPython enabled MCU boards, like the Grand Central M4 Express, Metro M4 Express, and Circuit Playground Express (M0+).  Their various installation instructions emphasize Windows, Mac, and standard Linux (amd64) host platform, but no specifics about ARM64/aarch64 platforms.
