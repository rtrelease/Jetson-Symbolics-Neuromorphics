Psychiatry has had a long history of involvement in artificial intelligence research, most notably in the development circa [1966](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168) of the original clinical *chatterbot* (now *chatbot*) called [ELIZA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Author [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum) was then at MIT working with an early mainframe list-processing language (MAD-Slip) on *natural language* research funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Navy.

Such work stimulated an early research interest in *AI* in the mid-1980s, starting during my NIMH-sponsored postdoctoral Fellowship in Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Medicine.

Zoom to 2025, *computational psychiatry* is an established, diverse research sub-discipline after more than a decade since inception, with its own academic [journal](https://cpsyjournal.org). The former psychiatry post-doc is now an emeritus professor and NVIDA Jetson AGX edge applications and hardware integration developer working on computational neuroscience projects.

A quick review of Journal papers reveals the current great breadth and depth of current "cpsy" research and clinical applications. A comprehensive professional review of the conceptual field is available at [Nature Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01743-z.pdf).

As previously noted, it is now the era of generative AI, when the public is widely exposed to LLM-based chatbots and other network-based 'intelligent' advisory services.  From a personal perspective, it now only seems a matter of time before FDA-tested and approved commercial online computational psychiatry applications are accepted for "billable clinical consultations" by major healthcare systems and provider management.

So implementing edge computational psychiatry tools and applications for the Jetson and the upcoming DGX Spark is a worthwhile effort.

A [python revival of lost ELIZA code](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza) is available for an appreciation of the original application.
