Psychiatry has had a long history of involvement in artificial intelligence research, playing an early role in foundational neural network theory with [McCulloch & Pitts, 1943](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/mccolloch.logical.calculus.ideas.1943.pdf) from the Psychiatry Department of the University of Illinois School of Medicine.

Most notably, the development of a psychoanalytic conversation model circa [1966](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168) produced the original symbolic clinical *chatterbot* (now *chatbot*) called [ELIZA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Author [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum) was then at MIT working with an early mainframe list-processing language (MAD-Slip) on *natural language* research funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Navy.

The ELIZA chatterbot had a simple relationship to the Turing Test and its "Imitation Game", wherein the human-like conversations it emulated were based on questions that might be asked during a client-centered [Rogerian psychoanalysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy) session.

Such work also stimulated my early research interest in *AI* in the mid-1980s, starting during my NIMH-sponsored postdoctoral Fellowship in Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Medicine.

Zoom to 2025, *computational psychiatry* is an established, diverse research sub-discipline after more than a decade since inception, with its own academic [journal](https://cpsyjournal.org). This former psychiatry post-doc is now an emeritus professor and NVIDIA Jetson edge applications and hardware integration developer working on computational neuroscience projects.

A quick review of Journal papers reveals the current great breadth and depth of current "cpsy" basic research and clinical applications. A comprehensive professional review of the conceptual field is available at [Nature Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01743-z.pdf).

It is now the era of generative AI, when the public is widely exposed to LLM-based chatbots and other network-based 'intelligent' advisory services.  From a personal perspective, it now only seems a matter of time before FDA-tested and approved commercial online computational psychiatry applications are accepted for "billable clinical consultations" by major healthcare systems and provider management.

So implementing edge computational psychiatry tools and applications for the Jetson and the upcoming DGX Spark is a worthwhile effort.

A [python revival of lost ELIZA code](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza) is available for experimenting with basic symbolic chatterbot behavior, seen here running on an AGX Orin DK.

A first experiment with modeling ELIZA-like psychoanalitic behavior in a LLaMa 2-13B GPTQ model with essentially base chat and character settings including the name ELIZA.  The following iPad screens show an AGX Orin DK LLama 2 session running via *web*ui.
