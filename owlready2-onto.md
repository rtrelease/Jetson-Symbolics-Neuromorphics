### **Owlready2 revisited: Python programming and integration of OWL ontologies**

[Owlready2](https://github.com/pwin/owlready2/tree/master) is a pip installable Python module for accessing, programming, and developing with OWL (web ontology language) ontologies. It is compatible with Linux Python version 3.6 on, including aarch64 ARM systems.

This shows using Owlready2 with a simple Jupyter Notebook to access a local copy of the Gene Ontology on AGX Orin (JP 5.1.2).  To the left, Protege displays an expanded entity-based view of go-basic.owl.
