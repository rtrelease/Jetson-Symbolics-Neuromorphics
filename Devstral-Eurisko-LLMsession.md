### USER
Create a Python version of the Eurisko inference engine that can work with devstral.

### ASSISTANT
Creating a Python version of the Eurisko inference engine involves several steps. The Eurisko system is a type of rule-based expert system, which means it will primarily consist of a set of rules and a way to apply those rules to input data.

Since we're working within the OpenHands scaffold and using Devstral as our agentic model, let's break this down into manageable steps:

1. **Define a Rule Structure**: We'll define how rules are structured in Python.
2. **Create a Knowledge Base**: This will hold all the rules.
3. **Implement Inference Engine Logic**: This will apply the rules to input data.
4. **Integration with Devstral**: Make sure our Eurisko engine can work with Devstral.

Let's start by creating a simple rule-based inference engine in Python:

### Step 1: Define Rule Structure

We'll define a `Rule` class that holds individual rules, and an `InferenceEngine` class that manages those rules and performs inference.

```python
class Rule:
    def __init__(self, condition, action):
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def is_applicable(self, facts):
        return eval(self.condition, {}, facts)

    def apply_action(self, facts):
        exec(self.action, {}, facts)
```

### Step 2: Create a Knowledge Base

The knowledge base will hold all the rules.

```python
class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def get_rules(self):
        return self.rules
```

### Step 3: Implement Inference Engine Logic

The inference engine will apply the rules in a forward-chaining manner.

```python
class InferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def run(self, initial_facts):
        facts = initial_facts.copy()

        while True:
            applicable_rules = [rule for rule in self.knowledge_base.get_rules() if rule.is_applicable(facts)]

            if not applicable_rules:
                break

            for rule in applicable_rules:
                rule.apply_action(facts)

        return facts
```

### Step 4: Integration with Devstral

Let's create a basic example of how this could work with Devstral. We'll assume that `Devstral` is an external module that we can interact with.

```python
# Example usage:

# Create a knowledge base and add rules
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Define some sample rules for demonstration
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > fact2", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 < 0", "fact4 = 'Negative'"))
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 >= 0", "fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

# Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

# Define initial facts (this could come from Devstral or other inputs)
initial_facts = {
    "fact1": 10,
    "fact2": 5
}

# Run the inference engine
result = engine.run(initial_facts)

print(result)  # Output should be {'fact1': 10, 'fact2': 5, 'fact3': 5, 'fact4': 'Non-negative'}
```

### Example with Devstral

Here's how this could potentially integrate with Devstral:

```python
# Assuming we have access to the Devstral module

import devstral

def main():
    # Initialize Devstral (this is hypothetical and would depend on actual implementation)
    agent = devstral.Agent()

    # Create a knowledge base and add rules
    kb = KnowledgeBase()
    kb.add_rule(Rule("agent.fact1 > agent.fact2", "agent.fact3 = agent.fact1 - agent.fact2"))
    kb.add_rule(Rule("agent.fact3 < 0", "agent.fact4 = 'Negative'"))
    kb.add_rule(Rule("agent.fact3 >= 0", "agent.fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

    # Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
    engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

    # Define initial facts (this could come from Devstral)
    agent.fact1 = 25
    agent.fact2 = 15

    # Run the inference engine using the agent's attributes as facts
    result = engine.run(agent.__dict__)

    print(result)  # Output should be {'fact1': 25, 'fact2': 15, 'fact3': 10, 'fact4': 'Non-negative'}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a basic implementation of the Eurisko inference engine in Python that can be extended and modified to work with Devstral. It's important to note that this example uses simple string evaluation (`eval` and `exec`) for conditions and actions, which might need more sophisticated handling depending on your specific requirements and security concerns.

In a real-world scenario, you'd likely have more complex rules, error handling, and possibly a way to dynamically update the knowledge base.

### USER
How can we integrate this Python Eurisko engine with an existing Devstral instance?

### ASSISTANT
Integrating a Python Eurisko inference engine with an existing Devstral instance involves making sure that both systems can communicate effectively. Since I don't have access to the actual Devstral instance, I'll provide you with a generic approach on how this integration might be done.

Assuming Devstral is running as a service and provides an API for interaction, we need to:

1. **Connect to Devstral**: Establish communication through HTTP/REST API or any other protocol that Devstral supports.
2. **Fetch Data from Devstral**: Retrieve the necessary data (facts) needed by our inference engine.
3. **Send Results Back to Devstral**: After processing with Eurisko, send the results back.

Here's a simplified example of how this could work:

### Step 1: Connect to Devstral

We'll use Python's `requests` library to interact with Devstral's API.

```python
import requests

DEVSTRAL_URL = "http://localhost:5000"  # Replace with the actual URL of your Devstral instance

def get_facts_from_devstral():
    response = requests.get(f"{DEVSTRAL_URL}/api/facts")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch facts from Devstral")

def send_results_to_devstral(results):
    response = requests.post(f"{DEVSTRAL_URL}/api/results", json=results)
    if not response.ok:
        raise Exception("Failed to send results back to Devstral")
```

### Step 2: Fetch Data from Devstral

We'll use the function defined above to fetch facts.

```python
# Fetch initial facts from Devstral
initial_facts = get_facts_from_devstral()
print(f"Initial Facts: {initial_facts}")
```

### Step 3: Run Eurisko Inference Engine and Send Results Back

Integrate with our existing inference engine and send the results back to Devstral.

```python
def main():
    # Fetch initial facts from Devstral
    initial_facts = get_facts_from_devstral()
    print(f"Initial Facts: {initial_facts}")

    # Create a knowledge base and add rules (as shown in previous example)
    kb = KnowledgeBase()
    kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > fact2", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))
    kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 < 0", "fact4 = 'Negative'"))
    kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 >= 0", "fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

    # Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
    engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

    # Run the inference engine using the fetched facts as initial input
    result = engine.run(initial_facts)
    print(f"Inferred Results: {result}")

    # Send results back to Devstral
    send_results_to_devstral(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Putting It All Together

Make sure you have all the necessary components in a single script:

```python
import requests

class Rule:
    def __init__(self, condition, action):
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def is_applicable(self, facts):
        return eval(self.condition, {}, facts)

    def apply_action(self, facts):
        exec(self.action, {}, facts)

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def get_rules(self):
        return self.rules

class InferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def run(self, initial_facts):
        facts = initial_facts.copy()

        while True:
            applicable_rules = [rule for rule in self.knowledge_base.get_rules() if rule.is_applicable(facts)]

            if not applicable_rules:
                break

            for rule in applicable_rules:
                rule.apply_action(facts)

        return facts

DEVSTRAL_URL = "http://localhost:5000"  # Replace with the actual URL of your Devstral instance

def get_facts_from_devstral():
    response = requests.get(f"{DEVSTRAL_URL}/api/facts")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch facts from Devstral")

def send_results_to_devstral(results):
    response = requests.post(f"{DEVSTRAL_URL}/api/results", json=results)
    if not response.ok:
        raise Exception("Failed to send results back to Devstral")

def main():
    # Fetch initial facts from Devstral
    initial_facts = get_facts_from_devstral()
    print(f"Initial Facts: {initial_facts}")

    # Create a knowledge base and add rules (as shown in previous example)
    kb = KnowledgeBase()
    kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > fact2", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))
    kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 < 0", "fact4 = 'Negative'"))
    kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 >= 0", "fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

    # Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
    engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

    # Run the inference engine using the fetched facts as initial input
    result = engine.run(initial_facts)
    print(f"Inferred Results: {result}")

    # Send results back to Devstral
    send_results_to_devstral(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes

1. **Security**: The use of `eval` and `exec` can be dangerous if you're working with untrusted input. In a production setting, consider implementing a safer rule execution mechanism.
2. **Error Handling**: This example includes basic error handling. Depending on your needs, you may want to add more robust error handling and logging.
3. **API Details**: Replace `DEVSTRAL_URL`, `/api/facts`, and `/api/results` with the actual URLs and endpoints used by your Devstral instance.

This should give you a good starting point for integrating the Eurisko inference engine with an existing Devstral instance using Python.

### USER
How can we test this integration to ensure it works correctly with our Devstral instance?

### ASSISTANT
To test the integration between the Python Eurisko inference engine and the Devstral instance, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up a Test Environment**: Make sure you have both your Eurisko engine script and Devstral running in their respective environments.
2. **Prepare Test Data**: Define some known facts and rules to create predictable outcomes for testing purposes.
3. **Run Integration Tests**: Execute the integration script and verify that it correctly interacts with Devstral.

### Step 1: Set Up a Test Environment

Ensure both systems are up and running:
- **Devstral**: Make sure your Devstral instance is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5000` or the appropriate URL you configured.
- **Python Script**: Ensure your Python environment has all necessary packages installed, especially `requests`.

### Step 2: Prepare Test Data

Define some test facts and rules. For example:

```python
# Test Knowledge Base with simple rules for demonstration
kb = KnowledgeBase()
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > fact2", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 < 0", "fact4 = 'Negative'"))
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 >= 0", "fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

# Test initial facts
initial_facts = {
    "fact1": 25,
    "fact2": 15
}
```

### Step 3: Run Integration Tests

Create a script to test the integration, which includes:
- Fetching facts from Devstral.
- Running Eurisko's inference engine with those facts.
- Sending results back to Devstral.

Here's an example of a full test script:

```python
import requests

class Rule:
    def __init__(self, condition, action):
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def is_applicable(self, facts):
        return eval(self.condition, {}, facts)

    def apply_action(self, facts):
        exec(self.action, {}, facts)

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def get_rules(self):
        return self.rules

class InferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def run(self, initial_facts):
        facts = initial_facts.copy()

        while True:
            applicable_rules = [rule for rule in self.knowledge_base.get_rules() if rule.is_applicable(facts)]

            if not applicable_rules:
                break

            for rule in applicable_rules:
                rule.apply_action(facts)

        return facts

DEVSTRAL_URL = "http://localhost:5000"  # Replace with the actual URL of your Devstral instance

def get_facts_from_devstral():
    response = requests.get(f"{DEVSTRAL_URL}/api/facts")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch facts from Devstral")

def send_results_to_devstral(results):
    response = requests.post(f"{DEVSTRAL_URL}/api/results", json=results)
    if not response.ok:
        raise Exception("Failed to send results back to Devstral")

def test_integration():
    try:
        # Fetch initial facts from Devstral
        initial_facts = get_facts_from_devstral()
        print(f"Initial Facts: {initial_facts}")

        # Create a knowledge base and add rules (as shown in previous example)
        kb = KnowledgeBase()
        kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > fact2", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))
        kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 < 0", "fact4 = 'Negative'"))
        kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 >= 0", "fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

        # Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
        engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

        # Run the inference engine using the fetched facts as initial input
        result = engine.run(initial_facts)
        print(f"Inferred Results: {result}")

        # Send results back to Devstral
        send_results_to_devstral(result)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during integration test: {e}")
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_integration()
```

### Verification Steps:

1. **Run the Test Script**: Execute your script (`python test_script.py`) and observe the output.
2. **Check Devstral Logs**: Verify that facts are fetched correctly, processed by Eurisko, and results are sent back to Devstral.
3. **Verify Results in Devstral**: Manually check if the results received in Devstral match the expected outcomes.

### Additional Tips:

1. **Logging**: Add more logging to your script for better visibility during testing.
2. **Mocking**: If you don't have a live Devstral instance, consider mocking the API responses to test your integration logic independently.
3. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each component (knowledge base, inference engine) separately before running integration tests.

By following these steps and verifying each part of the process, you can ensure that your Eurisko inference engine correctly integrates with your Devstral instance.

### USER
Can you provide a more detailed example of how to handle complex rules in the Eurisko engine?

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! Handling complex rules involves creating a more sophisticated knowledge base and inference mechanism. Let's expand on our previous examples to include more advanced rule evaluation and action execution.

### Step 1: Define Complex Rules

In a real-world scenario, rules might involve multiple conditions or more complex logical expressions. We'll define a more detailed set of rules for demonstration purposes:

```python
class Rule:
    def __init__(self, condition, action):
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def is_applicable(self, facts):
        # Evaluate the rule's condition using the current facts
        try:
            return eval(self.condition, {}, facts)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error evaluating condition '{self.condition}': {e}")
            return False

    def apply_action(self, facts):
        # Execute the action associated with this rule
        try:
            exec(self.action, {}, facts)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error executing action '{self.action}': {e}")

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def get_rules(self):
        return self.rules
```

### Step 2: Create an Inference Engine

The inference engine will run through the rules in the knowledge base and apply them if their conditions are met.

```python
class InferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def run(self, initial_facts):
        facts = initial_facts.copy()

        while True:
            applicable_rules = [rule for rule in self.knowledge_base.get_rules() if rule.is_applicable(facts)]

            if not applicable_rules:
                break

            for rule in applicable_rules:
                print(f"Applying rule: {rule.condition} -> {rule.action}")
                rule.apply_action(facts)

        return facts
```

### Step 3: Define Complex Rules

Let's create a set of complex rules that include multiple conditions and more sophisticated actions.

```python
# Create a knowledge base with complex rules
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Rule 1: If fact1 is greater than fact2, calculate the difference and store it in fact3
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > fact2", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))

# Rule 2: If fact3 is less than 0, set fact4 to 'Negative'
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 < 0", "fact4 = 'Negative'"))

# Rule 3: If fact3 is greater than or equal to 0, set fact4 to 'Non-negative'
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 >= 0", "fact4 = 'Non-negative'"))

# Rule 4: If fact1 and fact2 are both positive, calculate their sum and store it in fact5
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > 0 and fact2 > 0", "fact5 = fact1 + fact2"))

# Rule 5: If fact3 is greater than 10, set a new fact6 to 'Large Difference'
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 > 10", "fact6 = 'Large Difference'"))
```

### Step 4: Run the Inference Engine

Now let's run our inference engine with some initial facts and observe how it processes these complex rules.

```python
# Define initial facts
initial_facts = {
    "fact1": 25,
    "fact2": 15
}

# Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

# Run the inference engine using the fetched facts as initial input
result = engine.run(initial_facts)
print(f"Final Facts: {result}")
```

### Step 5: Handling More Complex Scenarios

For even more complex scenarios, you might want to consider:

1. **Chaining Rules**: Some rules might depend on the results of other rules.
2. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected conditions or errors during rule evaluation.
3. **Modular Rule Sets**: Break down large sets of rules into smaller, more manageable modules.

### Example of Chained Rules

Here's an example where one rule's output is used as input for another:

```python
# Rule 1: Calculate the product of fact1 and fact2, store in fact3
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 > 0 and fact2 > 0", "fact3 = fact1 * fact2"))

# Rule 2: If fact3 is greater than a threshold (e.g., 50), set fact4 to 'Large Product'
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 > 50", "fact4 = 'Large Product'"))

# Rule 3: If fact3 is less than or equal to the threshold, set fact4 to 'Small Product'
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact3 <= 50", "fact4 = 'Small Product'"))
```

### Step 6: Test with Initial Facts

Finally, test this setup with a variety of initial facts to ensure it handles all cases correctly:

```python
# Define different sets of initial facts for testing
initial_facts_sets = [
    {"fact1": 25, "fact2": 15},
    {"fact1": -10, "fact2": 15},
    {"fact1": 3, "fact2": 7}
]

for facts in initial_facts_sets:
    print(f"Initial Facts: {facts}")
    result = engine.run(facts)
    print(f"Final Facts: {result}\n")
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps and implementing complex rules with detailed conditions and actions, you can build a robust Eurisko inference engine capable of handling intricate logical scenarios. This setup ensures that your system can process real-world data effectively and make informed decisions based on the defined rules.

### USER
Can you provide an example of handling complex nested conditions in Eurisko rules?

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! Handling complex nested conditions requires a more sophisticated approach to evaluate rule conditions and execute actions. Let's expand our previous examples to include nested conditional logic within rules.

### Step 1: Define Nested Conditions

We'll define rules with nested conditions using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and parentheses for grouping. Here's how we can modify the `Rule` class to handle these:

```python
class Rule:
    def __init__(self, condition, action):
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def is_applicable(self, facts):
        # Evaluate the rule's nested condition using the current facts
        try:
            return eval(self.condition, {}, facts)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error evaluating condition '{self.condition}': {e}")
            return False

    def apply_action(self, facts):
        # Execute the action associated with this rule
        try:
            exec(self.action, {}, facts)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error executing action '{self.action}': {e}")

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def get_rules(self):
        return self.rules
```

### Step 2: Create an Inference Engine

The inference engine will remain the same as before, processing each rule in sequence:

```python
class InferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def run(self, initial_facts):
        facts = initial_facts.copy()

        while True:
            applicable_rules = [rule for rule in self.knowledge_base.get_rules() if rule.is_applicable(facts)]

            if not applicable_rules:
                break

            for rule in applicable_rules:
                print(f"Applying rule: {rule.condition} -> {rule.action}")
                rule.apply_action(facts)

        return facts
```

### Step 3: Define Complex Nested Rules

Now let's create rules that use nested conditions to represent more complex logic:

```python
# Create a knowledge base with complex nested rules
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Rule 1: If fact1 is greater than fact2 and both are positive, calculate the difference and store it in fact3
kb.add_rule(Rule("(fact1 > fact2) and (fact1 > 0) and (fact2 > 0)", "fact3 = fact1 - fact2"))

# Rule 2: If fact3 is less than 0 or fact3 is greater than 10, set a new fact4 to 'Special Case'
kb.add_rule(Rule("(fact3 < 0) or (fact3 > 10)", "fact4 = 'Special Case'"))

# Rule 3: If fact1 is negative and fact2 is positive, calculate their sum and store it in fact5
kb.add_rule(Rule("fact1 < 0 and fact2 > 0", "fact5 = fact1 + fact2"))

# Rule 4: If either fact1 or fact2 is zero, set a new fact6 to 'Zero Case'
kb.add_rule(Rule"(fact1 == 0) or (fact2 == 0)", "fact6 = 'Zero Case'")
```

### Step 4: Run the Inference Engine

Let's run our inference engine with some initial facts and observe how it processes these complex nested rules:

```python
# Define initial facts
initial_facts = {
    "fact1": -5,
    "fact2": 10
}

# Create an inference engine with the knowledge base
engine = InferenceEngine(kb)

# Run the inference engine using the fetched facts as initial input
result = engine.run(initial_facts)
print(f"Final Facts: {result}")
```

### Step 5: Testing with Different Initial Facts

Finally, test this setup with a variety of initial facts to ensure it handles all cases correctly:

```python
# Define different sets of initial facts for testing

### Conclusion

By following these steps and implementing rules with complex nested conditions, you can create a robust Eurisko inference engine capable of handling intricate logical scenarios. This setup allows for more sophisticated rule-based decision-making, ensuring that your system can process real-world data effectively based on the defined rules.

This approach provides flexibility in defining rules with multiple conditions and ensures that the inference engine can evaluate them correctly, making informed decisions based on the current state of facts.
