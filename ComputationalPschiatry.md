Psychiatry has had a long history of involvement in artificial intelligence research, most notably in the development circa 1966 of the original clinical chatbot called [ELIZA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Author [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum)

For me this interest drove my early research interest in *expert sysyems* in the mid-1980s, starting during my NIMH sponsored postdoctoral Fellowship in Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Medicine.

Zoom to 2025, computational psychiatry is a well established and diverse Research discipline, with its own academic [research journal](https://cpsyjournal.org). The early psychiatry post-doc is now an emeritus professor and NVIDA Jetson AGX edge applications and hardware integration developer.

A quick review of Journal papers reveals the current great breadth and depth of current "cpsy" research and clinical applications. 

From a personal perspective, it only seems a matter of time before FDA-tested and approved commercial online computational psychiatry applications are accepted for "billable clinical consultations" by major healthcare systems and provider management.

So implementing edge computational psychiatry tools for the Jetson and the upcoming DGX Spark seems a worthwhile effort.

A [python version of ELIZA](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza) is available for an appreciation of the original application.
