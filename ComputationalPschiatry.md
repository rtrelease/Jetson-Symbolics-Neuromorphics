Psychiatry has had a long history of involvement in artificial intelligence research, most notably in the development circa [1966](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168) of the original clinical *chatterbot* (now *chatbot*) called [ELIZA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Author [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum) was then at MIT working on early list-processing program (MAD-Slip) *natural language* research funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Navy.

Such work drove my early research interest in *expert systems* in the mid-1980s, starting during my NIMH sponsored postdoctoral Fellowship in Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Medicine.

Zoom to 2025, computational psychiatry is a well established and diverse Research discipline, with its own academic [research journal](https://cpsyjournal.org). The early psychiatry post-doc is now an emeritus professor and NVIDA Jetson AGX edge applications and hardware integration developer.

A quick review of Journal papers reveals the current great breadth and depth of current "cpsy" research and clinical applications. A comprehensive professional review of the field is available at [Nature Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01743-z.pdf).

From a personal perspective, it only seems a matter of time before FDA-tested and approved commercial online computational psychiatry applications are accepted for "billable clinical consultations" by major healthcare systems and provider management.

So implementing edge computational psychiatry tools for the Jetson and the upcoming DGX Spark seems a worthwhile effort.

A [python revival of lost ELIZA code](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza) is available for an appreciation of the original application.
