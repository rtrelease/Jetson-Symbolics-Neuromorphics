#### ELIZA's Grandchildren: Computational Psychiatry on the Edge in 2025

Psychiatry has had a long history of involvement in artificial intelligence research, most notably noticably in the development circa 1966 of the original therapeutic chatbot called [ELIZA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA).

For me this interest drove my early research interest in *expert sysyems* in the mid-1980s, starting during my NIMH sponsored postdoctoral Fellowship in Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Medicine.

Zoom to 2025, computational psychiatry is a well established and diverse Research discipline, with its own academic [research journal](https://cpsyjournal.org). The early psychiatry post-doc is now an emeritus professor and NVIDA Jetson AGX edge applications and hardware integration developer.

A [python version of ELIZA](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza) is available for an appreciation of the original application.

From a personal perspective, it only seems a matter of time before FDA-tested and approved commercial online applications are accepted for "billable clinical consultations" by major healthcare systems and provider management.
