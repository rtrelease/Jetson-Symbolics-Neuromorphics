> We need to answer: How can use Ollama LLMs with python owlready2 for using .owl ontologies with GTP-OSS? Likely the user wants to integrate local LLM (Ollama) with ontology reasoning via owlready2, maybe feeding ontology into prompt for GPT-OSS? We need to explain steps: install Ollama, get LLM, use python API to call model. Then use owlready2 to load ontology, query with SPARQL, maybe convert ontology to natural language, embed in prompt. Also show how to create embeddings or use model to reason on ontology. Provide code examples. Use GTP-OSS? I think GTP-OSS refers to GPT-OSS (open-source GPT). So integrate. Provide pipeline: load ontology, extract relevant info, ask LLM. Use context or prompt injection. Also maybe use the LLM to answer questions about ontology, or to generate code. Show how to embed the ontology in vector store. Also mention huggingface huggingface_hub, and local model inference via llama.cpp or ollama. Use python's ollama package: pip install ollama. Use `ollama.run` to get completion. Provide sample prompts: "Given the following OWL ontology snippet, what is the relationship between X and Y?" Use the ontology loaded into owlready2 to extract triples or descriptions.
> 
> Also mention usage of GTP-OSS as an LLM library; but maybe the user means using GTP-OSS to process queries? Provide code skeleton. Also mention concurrency and safety. Also mention using knowledge graph embeddings. Provide advanced example: generate semantic query via LLM, parse to SPARQL.
> 
> So produce answer with sections: prerequisites, installing Ollama, installing owlready2, loading ontology, extracting info, constructing prompt, calling Ollama, processing response. Show example. Also mention best practices. Also mention using `langchain_community.document_loaders`? But keep it simple.

Below is a practical “cook‑book” that shows you how to combine:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Ollama** | Run a local LLM (any `gpt‑oss`‑style model you’ve pulled into Ollama) |
| **Python** | Glue code that talks to Ollama, talks to an OWL file and does some light‑weight inference |
| **owlready2** | Load, inspect and run very light OWL reasoning (OWL‑lite/OWL‑DL) |
| **Optional – LangChain** | A convenient wrapper if you want to keep the prompt‑engineering part tidy |

The idea is to

1. **Load the ontology** in `owlready2`.
2. **Pull out the facts / axioms you care about** (e.g. all `rdfs:subClassOf` triples, all annotations, etc.).
3. **Turn that information into a prompt** you feed to the local LLM.
4. **Ask the LLM a question** (or let it generate a SPARQL query, a Python function, or a natural‑language answer).
5. **Return the answer to your app**.

Below is a step‑by‑step walkthrough with runnable snippets.

---

## 1. Install the prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.11+ recommended
pip install owlready2
pip install ollama      # python‑client for Ollama

# (Optional) If you want LangChain for prompt handling
pip install langchain langchain-community
```

### 1.1 Pull a local LLM into Ollama

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Example: install a 7B gpt‑oss model
ollama pull gpt-oss-7b
```

If you already have a different model, just replace the name.

---

## 2. Load the ontology with `owlready2`

```python
import owlready2 as owl
from pathlib import Path

def load_ontology(owl_file: str) -> owl.onto:
    """
    Load an OWL file and return the ontology object.
    """
    onto_path = Path(owl_file).resolve()
    onto = owl.get_ontology(str(onto_path)).load()
    return onto

onto = load_ontology("example_ontology.owl")
```

### 2.1 Quick inspection helpers

```python
def list_classes(onto):
    return [c.name for c in onto.classes()]

def list_object_properties(onto):
    return [p.name for p in onto.object_properties()]

def list_individuals(onto):
    return [i.name for i in onto.individuals()]

print("Classes:", list_classes(onto))
print("Object Properties:", list_object_properties(onto))
print("Individuals:", list_individuals(onto))
```

### 2.2 Export a minimal description

```python
def ontology_summary(onto, max_lines=20):
    """Return a short, human‑readable summary of the ontology."""
    desc = []
    for cls in onto.classes():
        # Class definition
        desc.append(f"Class: {cls.name}")
        # Super‑classes
        if cls.is_a:
            supers = ", ".join([s.name for s in cls.is_a if isinstance(s, owl.Thing)])
            desc.append(f"  Subclass of: {supers}")
        # Equivalent classes
        if cls.equivalent_to:
            eq = ", ".join([str(e) for e in cls.equivalent_to])
            desc.append(f"  Equivalent to: {eq}")
    return "\n".join(desc[:max_lines])

print(ontology_summary(onto))
```

## 3. Build the prompt

A clean prompt keeps the model focused. Two common patterns:

| Pattern | When to use it |
|---------|----------------|
| **Context‑First** | You feed the entire ontology snippet, then ask a question. |
| **Question‑First** | Ask a question that explicitly references the ontology’s namespace. |

### 3.1 Context‑First example

```python
# Take the first 1000 characters of the ontology file
with open("example_ontology.owl", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    ontology_text = f.read()[:1000]

prompt = f"""
You are an ontology expert. The following snippet is an excerpt of an OWL ontology:

{ontology_text}

Answer the following question:
What is the relationship between {list_classes(onto)[0]} and {list_classes(onto)[1]}?
"""
```

### 3.2 Question‑First example

```python
prompt = f"""
You have an ontology loaded with the following classes: {", ".join(list_classes(onto))}.
What does {list_classes(onto)[0]} inherit from in this ontology?
"""
```

**Tip:** Keep the prompt under ~2048 tokens if you’re using a small local model; otherwise, use a longer prompt and rely on your model’s context window.

---

## 4. Call Ollama from Python

```python
import ollama

def ask_llm(prompt: str, model: str = "gpt-oss-7b", temperature: float = 0.2, max_tokens: int = 512):
    """
    Sends a prompt to Ollama and returns the model’s response.
    """
    response = ollama.generate(
        model=model,
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        stream=False
    )
    return response["response"]

answer = ask_llm(prompt)
print("LLM says:", answer)
```

If you want streaming responses:

```python
for chunk in ollama.stream_generate(
        model="gpt-oss-7b",
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=0.2,
        max_tokens=512):
    print(chunk["response"], end="", flush=True)
```

---

## 5. Use the answer in your app

Typical use‑cases:

1. **Natural‑Language QA** – Show the answer to a user.
2. **Generate SPARQL** – Let the LLM produce a query, then execute it with `owlready2`.
3. **Code Generation** – The LLM can output Python code that manipulates the ontology.
4. **Ontology Extension** – The LLM can suggest new classes / axioms that you can validate with `owlready2`.

### 5.1 Example: LLM‑generated SPARQL

```python
# Prompt the LLM to produce a SPARQL query that finds all subclasses of a given class
sparql_prompt = f"""
You are a SPARQL expert. Given the ontology {onto.base_iri}, write a SPARQL query that returns all subclasses of the class {list_classes(onto)[0]}.
Answer with only the query.
"""

sparql_query = ask_llm(sparql_prompt)

print("Generated SPARQL:\n", sparql_query)

# Execute it
result = onto.query(sparql_query)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

---

## 6. Optional: Using LangChain for cleaner prompts

If you find yourself writing a lot of prompt‑building logic, LangChain can help:

```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.llms import Ollama

llm = Ollama(model="gpt-oss-7b")

template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["class_a", "class_b"],
    template=(
        "You have an ontology with the following classes: {classes}.\n"
        "What is the relationship between {class_a} and {class_b}?"
    ),
)

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=template)

response = chain.run(
    classes=", ".join(list_classes(onto)),
    class_a=list_classes(onto)[0],
    class_b=list_classes(onto)[1]
)
print(response)
```

---

## 7. Advanced: Embedding the ontology for retrieval

If you have a very large ontology and want to let the LLM query it by *retrieval‑augmented generation*:

1. **Embed the triples** with a sentence‑embedding model (e.g. `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
2. Store embeddings in a vector store (FAISS, Weaviate, or `pinecone`).
3. For a user query, embed the query, fetch the top‑k relevant triples, and paste them into the prompt.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# 1. Prepare a list of text snippets
triples = [
    f"{s} rdfs:subClassOf {o}"
    for s, p, o in onto.world.get_triples()
    if p == owl.onto.onto['rdfs:subClassOf']
]

# 2. Encode
model = SentenceTransformer("paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embeddings = model.encode(triples, convert_to_numpy=True)

# 3. Build FAISS index
d = embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)
index.add(embeddings)

# 4. Query
query_text = "What is a subclass of Vehicle?"
query_vec = model.encode([query_text], convert_to_numpy=True)
D, I = index.search(query_vec, k=3)  # top‑3

retrieved = "\n".join([triples[i] for i in I[0]])

# 5. Build prompt with retrieved snippets
prompt = f"""
Here are some ontology facts relevant to your question:

{retrieved}

Answer: 
"""

print(prompt)
```

Now feed that prompt to Ollama and you get a more accurate answer that is grounded in the ontology.

---

## 8. Things to watch out for

| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| **Large ontologies** | Use FAISS retrieval or split the ontology into chunks. |
| **Model context limits** | Trim the prompt, or summarise the ontology. |
| **Model hallucinations** | Post‑process the LLM output, verify with owlready2. |
| **Ontology reasoning** | `owlready2` supports a small OWL‑DL reasoner; for heavy reasoning use `Pellet` or `HermiT` via Java interop. |
| **Thread‑safety** | The Ollama client is thread‑safe, but keep an eye on CPU/GPU load when batching. |

---

## 9. Wrap‑up

1. **Load** your `.owl` file with `owlready2`.
2. **Extract** the bits you care about (classes, properties, individuals, triples).
3. **Craft** a prompt that contains that context and a clear question or task.
4. **Send** the prompt to your local Ollama LLM using the Python API.
5. **Consume** the answer: show it to a user, run a generated SPARQL query, or generate new ontology axioms.

With this pattern you can build a local knowledge‑grounded LLM that speaks the language of OWL, all without sending data to a cloud provider. Happy coding!
