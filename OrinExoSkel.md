#### **AGX Orin DK A/V Tactical Exoskeleton in action: Sound and Vision**

The basic exoskeleton 'hypercube' frame was built from 100 mm lengths of MakerBeam XL (15 mm; top/bottom) and MakerBeam (10 mm; verticals) extruded aluminum beams with XL cube corners.

A single 'generic' 150 mm 2020 'Euro V Rail' (20 mm) is attached to the top rails and carries standard slotted 'Picatinny' rails for accessories like camera mounts, extension arms, and audio controllers.

The 'NATO' standard rail 1/4" + 3/8" threaded quick release clamps and 'adjustable friction power articulating magic arm' with 1/4" thread are from Small Rig.
