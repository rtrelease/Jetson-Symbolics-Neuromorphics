#### ***Jetson RBTX: Intelligent lab microcontroller and robotic data systems development***

Jetson systems themselves include multiple sub-processors and provisions for using additional external microprocessors, including via CANBUS.  

Previous Lab Notes have covered the use of Orin-programmed and USB-hosted Arduino-compatible ARM Cortex M 32 bit microcontrollers for hybrid device proces control and neuromorphic simulators. CircuitPython has become the primary programming language.

Newer Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compatible multi-sensor MCUs have been put to work as mobile robot controllers and then as data acquisition sub-systems for physiological recording.
